,Funding
,The project was funded by the United Kingdom’s Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) between 2014 and 2018 (ES/K007742/1) and the University of Melbourne between 2019 and 2020.

,Acknowledgments
,The authors would like to acknowledge the support of Hugo Decramer (formerly ETH Zurich) and Mika Morrissette (formerly University College London) in developing the membership list of networks identified in this dataset.

,Disclaimer
,"This dataset has been developed by University of Bristol, University of Melbourne, University of Michigan, University of Nevada Las Vegas and University College London researchers. It is intended to inform research, policy and public discussions on the present and future of cities. The authors have sought to ensure the accuracy of the material in this dataset, but they, the Melbourne Centre for Cities and the three universities above are not be held liable for any loss or damage incurred through the use of this information. As detailed below, the authors of the dataset would particularly stress to its intended users that the city networks membership represented here is a snapshot of late-2017 and accurate as of January 2018, and should be considered as such in more contemporary use of its data. For instance, the 100 Resilient Cities network reported here is no longer in existence in its reported form and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group membership has grown sizably since then. We would like to caution against causal inferences and comparisons with timeframes other than 2017-2018."

,Focus
,"City networks, also known as transnational municipal networks (TMNs), are organizations whose membership is comprised of city government representatives from around the world, and whose function is to enable improved municipal governance via formulating and providing access to a range of resources to member city governments, covering subject areas from conflict resolution to environmental sustainability."
,
,Dataset
,"This dataset represents one of the most comprehensive accounting of city government memberships as of late-2017, in city networks (also known as trans-national municipal networks, or TMNs), covering 84 networks and 10,343 cities in 208 countries. This accounts specifically for the collective and individual TMN memberships of each city government by category as follows: The number of concurrent memberships in all (84) TMNs observed collectively (Column J, “TMN”); a subset of the number of concurrent memberships specifically within the 31 environmentally-focused TMNs observed (Column K, “ETMN”); the individual memberships in specific, non-environmental TMNs (Columns L –  BL, colored in light blue); and the individual memberships in specific environmental TMNs (Columns BM – CQ, colored in green). Coordinates are included for each city to enable use in mapping software, such as ArcGIS, for spatially joining with other city-level datasets. To enable merging with other national-level datasets, we also include ISO 3166 Country Codes at the 2- and 3-digit level."
,
,"The networks represented in each category are listed in Table 1 in the separate ReadMe file. There, Figures 1 and 2 visualize the data geographically as graduated symbols representing relative concurrent memberships (Fig. 1) and network ties formed by TMN secretariat-member city connections (Fig 2). Total geographic coverage includes 10,343 cities in 208 countries. "
,
,Method
,"The dataset builds on a prior original pilot database of city networks, developed at the University of Oxford (Acuto and Rayner, 2016)[1], and subsequently refined at University College London (Acuto 2016)[2] which reviewed 202 city networks, including a sample of 100 internationally focused networks from which this dataset is derived. This global review of city networks has been carried out by researchers at University College London’s City Leadership Lab first and at the Melbourne Centre for Cities at the University of Melbourne after, led by Michele Acuto, in collaboration with Benjamin Leffel at University of California Irvine (2015 – 2017), at the University of Michigan (2021 – 2023) and then at University of Nevada, Las Vegas (2023 – 2024). It includes data derived both from desk research on these networks (202 networks), survey responses (102 international networks), and from interviews (49) directly with network managers and network secretariats from international networks."

,Analysis
,"Data from the TMN column is analyzed in Acuto and Leffel (2020),[1] which describes the full global landscape of memberships, and data from the ETMN column is analyzed in Leffel (2022),[2] which shows an association between urban greenhouse gas emissions reductions and concurrent ETMN memberships.
