AnomalyDetectionCityNetworks is a project focused on detecting anomalies in urban networks. Cities are complex systems with vast networks of infrastructure, services, and movement. Monitoring these networks for irregularities is crucial for maintaining efficient urban management. This project aims to identify and analyze anomalies that could indicate potential issues or opportunities in urban environments, using machine learning techniques.
